title: Terminal Commands
---

The terminal in Linux is an interface in which you can type and execute text-based commands. It allows for efficient management of the operating system and software, providing a direct way to interact with the system's kernel and services. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the terminal provides a lightweight, more controlled, and scriptable way of interacting with the computer.

## Accessing the Terminal

**Graphical Method**: On most Linux desktop environments, you can open the terminal from the applications menu. Look for "Terminal".

**Keyboard Shortcut**: Many distributions allow you to open a terminal window by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

## File Management Commands

### Basic Commands

- `pwd`: Prints the path of the working directory.
- `cd`: Changes the working directory, abbreviation for 'change directory'.
  - `cd` home: Go to home directory.
  - `cd ..`: Go 1 directory up.
  - `cd ../..`: Go 2 directories up.
  - `cd ../../etc`: Go 2 directories up and go to the specified folder.
  - `cd ~`: Go to your home directory.
- `mkdir`: Creates a folder inside the working directory.
  - `mkdir dir1`: Create folder in working directory.
  - `mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3`: Create multiple folders in working directory.
  - `mkdir ~/Desktop/dir1`: Create folder in specific directory.
  - `mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3`: Create parented folders in working directory.
- `ls`: Lists files in the working directory.
  - `ls -l -a` (list all files in rows with all info)
- `touch`: Creates a new empty file.
  - Example: `touch output.txt`
- `>`: Writes the output of a command to a file.
  - Example: `pwd > output.txt`
  - Writes the path of the working directory to the text file. (Overwrites the whole file).
- `>>:` Writes output of a command to the end of a file (append).
  - Example: `pwd > output.txt`

### Viewing and Manipulating File Content

- `cat`: Stands for Concatenate. This command allows us to create single or multiple files, view the content of a file, concatenate files, and redirect output in the terminal or files.
  - Example: `cat output.txt` (reads content of `output.txt` to the terminal).
- `mv`: Moves a file into a directory.
  - Example: `mv output.txt dir1` (moves `output.txt` to dir1 directory).
  - `mv dir1/*` . (move everything from dir1 to the working directory).
- `cp`: Copies a file.
  - Example: `cp output.txt output2.txt`
- `rm`: Removes a file.
  - ` rm output.txt` (removes `output.txt`)
  - ` rm -rf dir1` (removes `dir1` and everything in it recusively)
- `chmod`: Lets you change the mode of a file (permissions) quickly. It has a lot of options available with it.
- `sudo`: Stands for “superuser do,” letting you act as a superuser or root user while running a specific command. It's crucial for installing software or editing files outside the user's home directory.
  - `sudo apt install gimp`
  - `sudo cd /root`
- `file`: Determines the file type of a given file, using magic numbers.
  - Example: `file image.jpg` (Displays the file type.)
- `stat`: Displays detailed information about a file or file system.
  - Example: `stat filename.txt` (Shows file details including inode, size, and permissions.)
- `ln` (hard and symbolic links): Creates links between files.
  - Example (symbolic): `ln -s source.txt link.txt`
  - Example (hard): `ln source.txt link.txt`

### Viewing Large Files and Differences

- `less`: Better for viewing large files, displaying the content of a file one page at a time.
- `head`: Displays the first few lines of a file. By default, it shows the first ten lines.
- `tail`: Displays the last few lines of a file. By default, it shows the last ten lines.
- `diff`: Compares the contents of two files line by line, outputting lines that do not match.
  - Example: `diff file1.txt file2.txt` (Shows the differences line by line.)
- `sort`: 
  - Alphabetically: `sort file.txt`
  - Numerically: `sort -n file.txt`
  - Reverse order: `sort -r file.txt`
  - By column (second column as example): `sort -k 2 file.txt`
  - Human-readable sizes (e.g., 1K, 1M): `sort -h file.txt`


### Editing and Compression

- `nano`: Opens and edits the specified file. Nano is a powerful text editor in a terminal.
  - Example: `nano output.txt`
- `zip`: Compresses files and directories.
  - Example: `zip myzip.zip output1.txt output2.txt`

### Organizing and Finding Files

- `tree`: Displays files in a tree structure.
  - Example: `tree -L 1`
- `find`: Searches for files and directories based on criteria like name, modification date, size, and permissions. It's also capable of executing commands on the files found.
  - `find . -name "*.py"`     
  (Finds all .py files in the current directory and sub directories).
  - `find . -iname "*.py"`    
  (insensitive search).
  - `find /home/user/projects -type d -name build`    
  (Find all directories named build in the /home/user/projects directory).
  - `find /home/user -mtime -7`   
  (Find files modified in the last 7 days in the /home/user directory).
  - `find /var/log -size +100M`   
  (Find files larger than 100MB in the /var/log directory).
  - `find /home/user/images -name "*.jpg" -exec mv {} /home/user/backup \;`   
  (Find all .jpg files in the /home/user/images directory and move them to /home/user/backup).
  - `find /path/to/dir -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;`  
    (Find all .tmp files and delete them)
- `grep`: Stands for “global regular expression print”, a powerful command used for searching text using patterns.
  - `apt list | grep firefox` (Show all packages, but filter on the name “firefox”).
  - `grep "word" filename.txt` (Search for a specific word in a file)
  - `grep -r "word" /path/to/directory` (Search recursively in all files in a directory)
  - `grep -A 3 "pattern" filename.txt` (Search for a pattern and display 3 lines after the match)
  - `grep -i "pattern" filename.txt` (Search for a pattern ignoring case)
  - `grep -c "pattern" filename.txt` (Count the number of lines that match a pattern)

## General Commands

- `whoami`: Outputs the username of the current user.
- `echo`: Displays a line of text/string that is passed as an argument.
  - Example: `echo "Hello World"` (Displays "Hello World" in the terminal.)
- `clear`: Clears the terminal screen, making it blank.
- `man`: Shows the manual page for commands, providing detailed information about command usage and options.
  - Example: `man mkdir` (Displays the manual page for the mkdir command.)
- `info`: Shows a more in-depth guide for commands than the man command.
  - Example: `info mkdir` (Displays a more in-depth guide for the mkdir command.)
- `history`: Displays a list of commands previously entered in the terminal session.
  - `history` (Shows full command history.)
  - `history | tail -n 20` (Displays the last 20 commands.)
  - `history -c` (Clears the entire command history.)

## System Management Commands

### Processes Management

- `htop`: An interactive process viewer, offering a detailed overview of system processes and the ability to manage them directly.
- `kill`: Terminates processes by their process ID (PID) or name.
  - Examples:
    - `kill 533494` (- )Terminates the process with PID 533494.)
    - `killall firefox` (Terminates all processes named firefox (Note: kill firefox is not a standard syntax; use killall for process names))
- `ps aux`: Displays all running processes.
  - Examples:
    - `ps aux` (Shows all running processes.)
    - `ps aux | grep firefox` (Shows all running processes, filtered to include only those containing "firefox".)
- `nohup COMMAND &`: Executes a command that continues running in the background, immune to hangup signals.
  - `nohup`: A command that ensures a process continues to run after the terminal is closed by making it ignore the HUP (hangup) signal. This signal is typically sent when the terminal session is terminated, which would normally stop any running processes. nohup is useful for long-running operations that need to persist beyond a terminal session.
  - `&`: Appends to a command to execute it as a background job, allowing immediate return to the shell for further commands. This symbol is crucial for multitasking in a Unix/Linux environment, facilitating parallel process management.
  - Examples:
    - `nohup python script.py &` (Runs script.py in the background, ensuring it continues even if the terminal closes.)
- `Ctrl+Z`: Suspends a foreground process, moving it to the background in a stopped state. This allows the terminal to return to the prompt for other tasks while keeping the process's state intact.
- `jobs`: Lists all jobs with their statuses, useful for tracking suspended processes.
  - `bg`: Resumes a suspended job in the background (e.g., `bg %1` resumes job 1). If no job number is specified, bg resumes the most recent job.
  - `fg`: Moves a job into the foreground, continuing its execution interactively (e.g., `fg %1` for job 1). If no job is specified, fg affects the most recent job.

### System Resource and Information

- `du`: Displays the amount of disk space used by files and directories
  - `du -h /path/to/directory` (All directories human readable inside of directory)
  - `du -a -h /path/to/directory` (All files + directories human readable inside of directory)
  - `du -h --max-depth=1 /path/to/directory` (Short and human readable of directory with max depth to search)
- `df`: Displays disk space usage for all mounted filesystems.
  - Example: `df -h` (Displays in a human-readable format.)
`free`: Shows the amount of free and used memory in the system.
  - Example: `free -h` (Shows memory information in a human-readable format.)
- `top`: Displays an ongoing view of process activity in real time.

### System Health and Uptime

- `uptime`: Shows how long the system has been running along with load averages.
  - Examples:
    - `uptime` (Basic usage, shows current uptime.)
    - `uptime -s` (Shows the system's last boot date.)
- `uname`: Displays system information such as the kernel name, version, and more.
  - Example: `uname -a` (Shows all system information.)

### Time and Date Management

- `date`: Displays or sets the system date and time.
  - Example: `date` (Shows the current date and time.)
- `timedatectl`: Controls the system time and date on systemd systems, also allows for setting time zones and configuring NTP.
  - Example: `timedatectl` (Displays the current time settings.)

### System Control

- `shutdown`: Safely shuts down or reboots the system.
x    - `shutdown now` (Shuts down the system immediately.)
    - `shutdown -r +10` (Reboots the system after a 10-minute delay.)
