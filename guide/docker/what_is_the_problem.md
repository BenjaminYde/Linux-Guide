# What is the problem?

The company behind Docker, also called Docker, has always described the program as
fixing the 'it works on my machine' problem. This problem is best summed up by an image, based on the Disaster Girl meme, which simply had the tagline 'Worked fine in
dev, ops problem now'. While it is funny, it is, unfortunately, an all-too-real problem.

Even in a world where DevOps best practices are followed, it is still all too easy for a
developer's working environment to not match the final production environment.

## Developers

- **Inconsistent Development Environments**: Developers may need to work on different machines or operating systems, which can cause inconsistencies in development environments and make it difficult to reproduce bugs or errors.

- **Version control:** It can be difficult to ensure that all developers are using the same version of tools and dependencies, which can lead to version conflicts and other issues.

- **Dependency Conflicts**: Managing dependencies for an application can be challenging, especially when multiple applications have conflicting dependencies. Developers may need to manually manage dependencies, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

- **Platform-specific dependencies**: Some dependencies may only be available on specific operating systems or hardware, which can create challenges for cross-platform development.

- **Testing Challenges**: Testing an application in different environments can be difficult, since it may require manual setup and configuration.

## Operators

- **Configuration drift**: It can be difficult to ensure consistent configuration across different environments, which can lead to issues with stability, performance, and security.

- **Resource utilization**: Managing resources efficiently can be challenging, which can lead to unnecessary costs and reduced performance.

- **Deployment Complexity**: Deploying applications can be complex, since it may require different installation procedures or configurations on different systems.

- **Scalability Challenges**: Scaling an application can be challenging since it may require manual setup and configuration of additional hardware or virtual machines.

- **Security Risks**: It can be challenging to maintain consistent security configurations across different systems, which can increase the risk of security vulnerabilities and breaches.

- **Vendor lock-in**: Applications may be tied to specific cloud providers or infrastructure, limiting flexibility and making it difficult to switch providers if necessary.

## Enterprises

- **Infrastructure Complexity**: Managing infrastructure can be complex, especially when dealing with multiple applications or different types of infrastructure.

- **Time to Market**: It may take longer to deploy and update applications, which can slow down time to market and hinder innovation.

- **Limited Portability**: Applications may be tied to specific infrastructure or cloud providers, limiting the ability to move them to different environments.

- **Limited visibility**: Without Docker, it can be difficult to gain visibility into the health and performance of applications across different environments, which can make it challenging to identify and address issues quickly.

- **Legacy system integration**: Integrating with legacy systems can be challenging, which can limit the ability to modernize and streamline business processes.

- **Compliance challenges**: It can be difficult to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, as different environments may have different security configurations and policies.
